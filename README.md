# Weather Prediction With Python And Machine Learning

GOAL_
The goal of weather prediction using machine learning is to improve the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasting. 
Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical weather data to learn patterns and relationships between different weather variables,
such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and use this information to make predictions about future weather conditions.

PROCESS_
To develop a weather prediction model using machine learning, a large dataset of historical weather data is collected, cleaned,
and preprocessed to ensure that it is suitable for training the model.
Various machine learning algorithms can then be applied, to train the model on the weather data.

DETAILS OF FEATURES_
Important features of a weather prediction model using machine learning include its accuracy, the ability to make predictions in real-time,
and the ability to handle and incorporate new data as it becomes available. Additionally, the model should be able to identify patterns and
relationships in the data that may not be immediately obvious to human analysts, which can lead to more accurate and reliable weather predictions.
